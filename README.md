# Commitizen | Simple to use 🚀

## Tired of closing tags by hand? 😪😪
When you finish your work, do an explicit commit:
```
  yarn commit
```

You will be prompt with some questions, asking for the type of development, what you've done, related issues and others. Then, magic happens.

Run this line:
```
  yarn bump

  git push --follow-tags origin master
```

Based on your commit messages, your changelog will be automatically updated and the tag will be created! 🎉🍾
